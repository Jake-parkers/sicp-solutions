Each of the following two procedures defines a method for adding two positive integers in terms of the procedures inc, which increments its argument by 1, and dec, which decrements its argument by 1.

`
(define (+ a b)
    (if (= a 0) b (inc (+ (dec a) b))))

(define (+ a b)
    (if (= a 0) b (+ (dec a) (inc b))))
`   
Using the substitution model, illustrate the process generatedby each procedure in evaluating (+ 4 5). Are these processes iterative or recursive?

## Solution

### Procedure 1

`
(+ 4 5)
(inc (+ 3 5))
(inc (inc (+ 2 5)))
(inc (inc (inc (+ 1 5))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc (+ 0 5)))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc 5))))
(inc (inc (inc 6)))
(inc (inc 7))
(inc 8)

`
The process generated by `Procedure 1` is recursive in nature

### Procedure 2
`
(+ 4 5)
(+ 3 6)
(+ 2 7)
(+ 1 8)
(+ 0 9)

`
The process generated by `Procedure 2` is interative in nature. Procedure 2 makes use of the tail-recursive technique. 

In tail recursion, the function call to itself is usually the last bit of work to be done in the function and hence there's no need to return control to the caller to inspect or modify the its result before returning it.

Contrast this with `Procedure 1` where we have `(inc (+ (dec a) b))`. After the result of `(+ (dec a) b)` is returned, work still needs to be done to the result i.e applying the procedure `inc` to it in order to increment its value by 1. Hence because the interpreter needs to remember this extra work done, Procedure 1 generates a recursive pocess.
